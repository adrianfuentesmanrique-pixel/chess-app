# Chess app — where things stand (updated 2026-08-07)

## Already done and pushed — do NOT redo these

- **Game History (Stockfish games) — COMPLETE, all 4 tasks.** Every game you
  play against the engine is saved automatically and can be browsed, filtered
  and replayed. Reach it from **Play → 📜 Game History**.
  - New module **`js/history.js`** — record building, the history screen, and
    replay. New IndexedDB store `playHistory` (DB v2 → **v3**).
  - Replay opens the normal Analysis board with a `historyId` context, so the
    tab bar stays lit on Play and there is a back / prev / next bar plus a
    one-line headline. `⋯ → 👁 View PGN` shows the game text; games can be
    exported or deleted from the card long-press or from `⋯`.
  - Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-07-stockfish-game-history.md`.
    Commits `a8705f7`, `9a90522`, `d302722`, `a86947e`.
  - **`js/app.js` now exports things.** It used to export nothing. `toast`,
    `modal`, `askConfirm`, `sheet`, `segInit`, `segValue`, `sharePgnText` and
    `Analysis` are exported so `js/history.js` can import them instead of
    copying them. app.js and history.js import each other — the cycle is
    deliberate and safe, but `js/history.js` must never touch an app.js
    binding at module top level. See "The module boundary" in the plan.
  - Deliberately left out: resuming an unfinished game, board thumbnails,
    clocks, cloud sync. The record shape already supports all four.

- **`sw.js` is at `chess-training-center-v24`.** The `v11` written here
  earlier was stale for a long time — trust the file, not this note, and bump
  it whenever `index.html`, any `js/*.js` or `css/style.css` changes, or
  returning users get served stale files.

Latest commit: see branch `refactor/split-app-js`

- **Work order #1 — both Sentry errors.** One was a real null-dereference:
  tapping the Openings board before pressing Start crashed the app. The other
  (`myUndefinedFunction`) came from a browser extension, not this codebase; the
  crash guard and Sentry now ignore extension-attributed errors.
- **#4 — trash button removed** from Board Setup (13 → 12 buttons).
- **#5 — board scrolling fixed.** `.board` had `touch-action: none`, so the
  board swallowed every gesture. Now `pan-y`.
- **#9 — "Jaques mate" → "Jaque mates"** in the Spanish Learn tab.
- **Kael's corner no longer swallows taps** (commit `242dc7f`) — he is quieter,
  hides off-screen when silent, and the bubble is see-through. This was the
  urgent touchscreen bug; it is FIXED.
- Endgame tab: 265 endgames, bilingual, live.

## Still to do

**`HANDOFFS.md` is stale — tasks A–D in it are all done.** Ignore the table
below and the prompts in that file until someone rewrites them.

One conversation each:

| | Task | Work order items |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | Artwork integration | #2 — *blocked on 2 questions* |
| **B** | Learn reorganisation + tab reorder | #8 + #12 — must ship together |
| **C** | Swipe nav + Opening Explorer variations | #10 + #11 |
| **D** | Button work | #3, #6, #7 |

Lower priority, not in the work order:
1. Export Firestore security rules to `firestore.rules` — they only exist in the
   Firebase console.
2. Test the Firestore WRITE rules. Read rules were verified live; write rules
   never were. Writes to production — ask first.
3. Restrict the Firebase web API key by HTTP referrer in Google Cloud Console.
4. Puzzle difficulty does not scale with ELO (Adrian is 2000+, still gets easy
   problems).
5. History dates older than yesterday show the month in the *device's*
   language, not the app's — `formatWhen()` in `js/history.js` calls
   `toLocaleDateString(undefined, …)`. In Spanish on an English phone you get
   "Aug 5 13:16". Passing `getLang()` instead of `undefined` fixes it. Cosmetic
   and pre-existing to Task 2; not fixed because it was outside Task 4.
5. New "Read" tab — PDF reader, brief in `READ-TAB-PROMPT.md`. Later.

## Token rules — paste these into every new chess session

```
Working on C:\Users\Adrian\chess-app. Read HANDOVER.md first.
- js/app.js is 235 KB (~57,000 tokens). NEVER read it whole. Grep for the
  symbol, then read with offset/limit. Check the small modules first —
  Sound, Themes, ColorMode, Avatars, Badges, Leaderboard and PublicProfile
  are no longer in app.js.
- Never read puzzles/*.json (5.1 MB) or graphify-out/graph.json (292 KB).
  Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md instead — it is 8 KB.
- js/endgames-data.js (212 KB) is data. Grep only.
- One task per conversation. Tell me to /clear when this one is finished.
```

## Structural debt — splitting js/app.js (IN PROGRESS)

The dedicated session happened on 2026-08-07. **`js/app.js` went from 255 KB to
235 KB (~8%).** Five modules are out, each its own commit, each verified in a
real browser before the next one started. Branch `refactor/split-app-js`.

This was a **pure refactor**: every block was moved verbatim. No behaviour, no
visuals, no storage keys changed.

### New file layout

| File | Holds | Size |
|---|---|---|
| `js/sound.js` | `Sound` | 0.7 KB |
| `js/appearance.js` | `Themes`, `ColorMode` | 2.0 KB |
| `js/avatars.js` | `AVATAR_OPTIONS`, `avatarHtml()`, `Avatars` | 2.6 KB |
| `js/badges.js` | `BADGE_DEFS`, `badgeLabel()`, `Badges` | 7.9 KB |
| `js/leaderboard.js` | `LEADERBOARD_FIELDS`, `rankTier()`, `Leaderboard`, `VISIBILITY_SECTIONS`, `canSee()`, `withLocalDetail()`, `PublicProfile` | 9.0 KB |
| `js/engine.js` | gained `LEVELS` (was in app.js) | — |

### How the split works — read this before extracting the next one

`js/app.js` is still the entry module and now exports 18 things: `$`, `toast`,
`modal`, `askConfirm`, `sheet`, `esc`, `segInit`, `segValue`, `showScreen`,
`monthStr`, `radarThemes`, `sharePgnText`, `activeScreen`, `RADAR_MIN`,
`KaelQuotes`, `Analysis`, `Setup`, `Profile`.

Child modules import those back from app.js, so app.js and every child form an
import cycle. **The cycle is safe only while the child never touches an app.js
binding at module top level** — inside methods and event handlers is fine,
because both modules have finished evaluating by then. A
`Cannot access '...' before initialization` error means exactly that mistake.

`LEVELS` moving to `js/engine.js` is the worked example. `BADGE_DEFS` is built
at module top level and maps over `LEVELS`, so reading it from app.js across
the cycle would have crashed the app. Anything a child needs **at top level**
must live in a module that does not import app.js back.

`activeScreen` is an exported `let`. ES module bindings are live, so children
see `showScreen()` reassign it. Do not copy it into a local variable.

### Still in js/app.js — 18 of the 23 objects

`Onboarding 439`, `KaelQuotes 513`, `Streak 814`, `DailyMissions 912`,
`Analysis 1212`, `Base 1852`, `Play 2310`, `GameReview 2593`, `Trainer 2702`,
`PuzzleLog 3092`, `Puzzles 3198`, `Rush 3681`, `Blind 3948`, `Endgame 4240`,
`Setup 4888`, `Profile 5212`. (Line numbers as of this commit.)

Next best candidates, in order: `PuzzleLog` and `GameReview` (both fairly
self-contained), then `Streak` + `DailyMissions` together, then `Onboarding`.
`Analysis`, `Play`, `Puzzles` and `Endgame` are the big ones and are heavily
cross-wired — leave those until last.

### The rules that made this safe (keep following them)

1. One module per commit. Verify before starting the next.
2. Move code **verbatim**. Do not tidy it on the way out.
3. Every new `js/*.js` goes in the `ASSETS` array in `sw.js` **and** the cache
   version gets bumped. `sw.js` is now at **`chess-training-center-v29`**.
4. Never rename a storage key: `'endgame'`, `puzzleElo`, `endgameElo`,
   `openingElo`, `blindfoldElo`, `earnedBadges`, avatar ids, badge ids, and
   the `LEVELS` index (persisted in `engineLevelsBeaten`).

### How this was verified

There is no test framework, so verification means driving the real app. The
Claude browser pane still will not composite, so a small CDP driver against
headless Chrome was used instead (scripts in the session scratchpad;
`~/.claude/launch.json` entry `chess-app46`, port 9159). After each extraction:
boot with zero new console errors, all 7 tabs open, Play → start → 64 squares
and 32 pieces, Game History → card renders → replay opens Analysis with the
tab bar still lit on Play, Profile radar + 64 trophy cells, 375px in light and
dark, and an offline reload with the network cut.

**Observed, not fixed** (out of scope for a pure refactor):
- `js/learning-data.js`, `js/quotes-data.js`, `js/legal-data.js` and
  `js/openings-eco.js` are imported by app.js but are **not** in the `sw.js`
  `ASSETS` array. Offline still works because the network-first handler caches
  them after the first load, but a user whose very first launch goes offline
  mid-install would not have them precached. Pre-existing, unrelated to the
  split.
- The only console error during every run is a `403` from
  `content-firebaseappcheck.googleapis.com`. It is App Check rejecting an
  unregistered origin (`127.0.0.1:9159`) and appears identically before and
  after the refactor.

## Housekeeping

`avatars/CTC new arts/` and `tools/` are still untracked in git. Commit them
before starting task A so the new art is not at risk.
